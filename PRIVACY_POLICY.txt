a) Crash Reports (Optional)
   - If you opt-in to crash reporting, we may collect technical information about application crashes to help us improve stability.

4. FUTURE CLOUD SERVICES

Data transmitted will be retained only as long as necessary to provide the requested functionality, and then securely deleted.
